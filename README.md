# Sort Visualizer

This is a progressive web app built using React to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, and others.

The app is deployed and can be accessed [here](https://algo-visualiser-a5hi.onrender.com).

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to enhance my skills with React while simultaneously learning classic sorting algorithms. This project has been an excellent opportunity to achieve both goals.
